Though not everyone is a born communicator, there are proven ways to improve your communication skills. Here are 10 ways:-

Listen Well

To be a good communicator, you first have to listen well. Communication is hampered when one of the parties involved is not listening properly. By paying attention, you get every important detail of the communication, and you also improve on how to communicate back well.

Be to the Point

Majority of the miscommunication happens when there is too much needless information. Keep your communication concise without compromising on the importance of it. This applies to both written and verbal communication. For written communication, proofread, and for verbal communication, practice saying only what is important to the conversation.

Know Your Listener

You have to know who you are communicating with, and have to gauge what type of communication they are going to understand. For example, if you are communicating with a colleague or a senior, obviously informal language should not be used. Also, if you use acronyms, you cannot assume that the other person will immediately understand. So, know your listener.

Assertive & Active Voice

The language you use in your communication should be assertive and active. This form of language instantly grabs the attention of the listener or reader. They will latch on to your every word and the right message will be passed on.

Body Language

Body language is a great way to communicate without words but still have a profound impact. When you are in a video conference call or face-to-face meeting, keep a positive body language like an open stance and eye contact. This is subconsciously read by the other person, and their body language also becomes positive.

Always Proofread

People assume they have not made a mistake and hit send on their written communication. Do not do this. Proofread what you have written once or twice before sending. One tip is that do not proofread immediately after writing. It’s harder to spot errors. Take a small break, give rest to your eyes, and then proofread.

Take Notes

When you are being communicated to, take down important points in the communication. This is a very simple but effective method to ensure there is no miscommunication.

Watch Your Tones

Most miscommunication happens because either of the parties involved was not speaking in the right tone. Don’t be too loud, don’t be too soft, and don’t be rude or condescending. Always communicate politely and respectfully with everyone.

Right Frame of Mind

When you are about to communicate, be sure that you are in the right frame of mind. Tiredness, frustration, sadness, and anger, among other range of emotions, can hamper what you want to communicate. Just make sure you are positive or at least neutral.

Speak Directly

Directly communicate with the person you mean to. In many organizations, communication channels are created with many needless people passing on the messages. As we know thanks to the Chinese whispers game, this does not work when there are too many people. Just communicate directly with the person you mean to.

Communication is something that has a substantial impact on our personal and professional life. It has to be taken seriously. And always remember some of the most successful and happy people in life are great communicators.', null,

VALUES ('Day 2','10 Ways to Deliver Consistently Great Customer Service', 'https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/training.jpg', 'You may have a fantastic product, but if your customer service is unhelpful, unreliable, or just plain hard to get in touch with, folks will hear about it, and you’ll lose customers over it.

That’s one big reason why investing in customer service is key to long-term business success.

But what does it mean to provide great customer service, and how can you ensure that every customer has a great experience with your company when they reach out for help? We’ve identified several ways to put your customer service at the top of the game in your industry.

What is great customer service?
Great customer service means following best practices like valuing customers’ time, having a pleasant attitude, and providing knowledgeable and resourceful resources, but that you also take things a step further to exceed — rather than just meet — expectations.

10 ways to deliver great customer service
While you can use many different methods to delight your customers and have them raving about your support to their friends, here are our 10 best ways to deliver great customer service.

1. Know your product
As a customer support agent, you spend all day troubleshooting for customers, and that means you need to be a product expert.

Expansive knowledge of your product is an essential customer service skill. Ideally, you should believe in your product, be able to discuss features and use cases in an insightful way, and show your customers how the product can benefit them — not to mention troubleshoot anything that’s not working right!

Your job is to help your customers get the most out of their purchase and feel like they have gotten true value for their money. Make it your goal to learn everything there is to know about your product so you can amaze your customers with timely recommendations for using new features and services.

2. Maintain a positive attitude
Attitude is everything, and a positive attitude goes a long way in providing excellent customer service.

“The right attitude changes negative customer experiences into positive customer experiences,” says Flavio Martins, VP of Operations and Customer Service at DigiCert, Inc. Since most customer interactions are not face-to-face, your attitude should be reflected in your language and tone of voice.

It’s easy to misinterpret the tone of written communication, and email or live chat can come across as cold. The brain uses multiple signals to interpret someone else’s emotional tone, including body language and facial expression, many of which are absent online.

Don’t be afraid to use emojis to convey warmth and good humor, or pick up the phone if you find an email or chat conversation getting tense.

3. Creatively problem-solve
Over 80% of customers have churned because they experienced bad customer service. That’s why you must thrive on solving problems for your customers and make it a central part of your support role — and there will always be problems to solve.

Everyone has heard of the legendary customer service at Zappos. For example, they once sent a best man free shoes the night before the wedding after his order was sent to the wrong location due to a mistake by the delivery company. Zappos solved a problem and exemplified excellent customer service — they won a customer for life and gave the man a story that he couldn’t wait to share.

Don’t be afraid to wow your customers as you seek to problem-solve for them. You could just fix the issue and be on your way, but by creatively meeting their needs in ways that go above and beyond, you’ll create customers that are committed to you and your product.

4. Respond quickly
66% of people believe that valuing their time is the most important thing in any online customer experience. Resolving customer queries as quickly as possible is a cornerstone of good customer service. Speed should be of the essence — especially for smaller issues that don’t take much time to solve.

That being said — great customer service beats speed every time.

Customers understand that more complex queries take time to resolve. There’s a difference between the time it takes you to respond and the speed at which you resolve their problems. Customers don’t want to languish in a ticket queue, but they’ll spend as much time as it takes to resolve their issue. You should, too.

Get back to your customers as quickly as possible, but don’t be in a rush to get them off the phone or close the ticket without resolving the issue completely.

5. Personalize your service
40% of customers say they want better human service. That means they want to feel like more than just a ticket number. They get angry when they’re not being treated like an individual person, receiving boilerplate responses, or being batted like a tennis ball to different people.

Customers want to interact with a person — not a company. It’s part of the reason why many businesses send gifts to their customers on their birthdays.

Do you know not only your customers’ names, but also their birthdays? How about their interests or hobbies? Can you make them laugh? It’s obviously not possible to do this for everyone, but going off script and giving the personal touch when you can is an important way to show your customers you know them and you care.

6. Help customers help themselves
That said, customers don’t always want to talk to someone to get their problem solved — often, they want to quickly resolve their issue themselves. Among consumers, 81% attempt to take care of matters themselves before reaching out to a live representative. Further research shows that 71% want the ability to solve most customer service issues on their own.

Self-service is a scalable, cost-effective way to make customers happy — that’s the thinking that led to Help Scout’s Beacon, which puts help content front and center so customers can find answers right where they are without leaving the page. Then if they’re unable to answer their own question, help from a real person is just a couple clicks away.' , null, null , null);

VALUES ('Day 3','Professional Sales Skills Tips And Techniques', null, '1. Effective Communication
The ability to clearly and effectively communicate across mediums is a non-negotiable for salespeople. Between drafting enticing sales emails, nailing presentations, and keeping conversations with buyers of all communication styles flowing, sales professionals must continuously hone their written and verbal communication skills to perform well in their role.

2. Product Expertise
Why should your prospects buy your product? If you aren’t sure what value your product offers and what the key features are, it’s impossible to convey these elements to your buyers. Additionally, selling the wrong product to your customer is a faux pas to avoid if you want happy returning buyers.

Salespeople should know the ins and outs of the products they are selling to reach their sales goals and sell their products to customers who are a good fit and more likely to be satisfied with their purchase.

Some of HubSpot’s top-performing salespeople are former support reps. They know the product inside and out, which allows them to give detailed help and recommendations to prospects. Buyers are eager to talk to them and are more receptive to discussing our paid products.

Overall, having deep product knowledge means you can answer any question that comes your way, devise creative solutions to customer problems, and offer consultations that’ll lead to opportunities. As buyers get better and better at solo research, product knowledge will help you better convey your unique selling proposition.

3. Customer Service
Top salespeople are able to engage and build rapport with the clients and customers they aim to serve. For reps, this can look like taking the time to learn about your customers and how your offering can alleviate their pain points, and asking meaningful discovery questions during your initial calls to establish a meaningful relationship.

4. Problem Solving
As a sales professional, your ultimate goal shouldn’t just be to close the deal — it should be to solve for the customer. That’s why reps should be expert problem solvers.

Not only should salespeople be able to solve the problems directly in front of them, such as helping customers overcome objections, but they should also be able to anticipate future challenges that may arise and proactively prepare solutions.

5. Business Acumen
What is your current level of business acumen? If it’s low, don’t panic, but make plans to focus on improving it. When salespeople have knowledge and expertise that informs their strategic outlook and understanding of the business they’re in, they become unstoppable.

Reps with strong business acumen are able to make strategic decisions that serve their organization now and in the future.

6. Sales Demoing
Walking your potential customer through a product demonstration is a critical element of the sales process, and it should be done with care. Your goal should be to take your prospects through an easy-to-follow demonstration to introduce them to your product and set the stage for the deal’s next steps.

7. Negotiating
Wouldn’t it be great if your prospects immediately signed your contracts agreeing to all payment terms? You’re probably thinking “yes, that would be great.” However, that’s not always how deals work. Even after vetting prospects and laying out a thoughtful quote, many deals still end up in a negotiation phase before the dotted line is signed.

That’s why strong negotiation skills are a must for salespeople. When reps are able to effectively negotiate terms with buyers and decision makers that are mutually beneficial, they’re more likely to secure better outcomes.

8. Prospecting
If you reach out first, 82% of buyers will accept a meeting request. That’s what makes prospecting so critical and so effective.

Yes, prospecting can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. However, all of that work doesn’t have to be in vain if you’re focusing on qualified leads who are a good fit for your product. Successful prospecting requires research, clear communication, and discernment — skills that can be improved upon.

9. Collaboration
While it can be tempting for reps to solely focus on hitting their personal numbers, sales is truly a team effort and collaboration is a must for creating a frictionless sales process.

Whether a rep needs to work with their marketing organization to ensure a smooth hand-off during the sales process, or is focused on collaborating with their prospect to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, salespeople should be agreeable and able to effectively work with people internal and external to their team to reach business goals.

10. Social Selling
If you think social media can only be leveraged by the marketing department, think again. Social selling, or researching and connecting with potential buyers using social media platforms, is an important skill for sales reps.

It’s worth noting, however, that social selling is only effective when done properly. That means reps shouldn’t flock to social media spamming user inboxes with unsolicited messages and flooding their timelines with promotional posts. Instead, reps should start by optimizing their professional social media profiles to attract potential customers, and take a thoughtful approach to outreach on the appropriate platforms at the appropriate times.' , null,

VALUES ('Day 5','5 Ways To Improve Employee Development At Your Company', 'http://www.tekshapers.com/uploads/blog_image/TrainingDevelopment.jpg','Every company has it’s own set of priorities to help take it to the next level, and knowing which initiatives will make the greatest impact can be tough. But what makes a business prosperous and truly differentiates one organization from the rest is not the product it sells or the service it offers, it’s the people within it. And what people at your org  deeply crave are more opportunities for employee development.

Taking care of your employees doesn’t simply mean offering fun happy hours or paying for lunch once a week. Each person, no matter their level or where they choose to work, wants to feel genuinely cared for. An impactful way to do this is through a commitment to support employee development (professional advancement and personal growth).

Employee development is a long-term initiative, but it also leads to short-term benefits like increased loyalty and improved performance and engagement. Here are five ways you can begin improving employee development at your company.

Learn how to keep remote employees engaged

1. Offer professional training from the get-go
Let’s get the obvious stuff out of the way.

Setting your employees up for success in their role starts with giving them all the tools and resources they need to do their job well. This includes professional training. You can practice this from an employee’s first day and beyond by creating a knowledge base of critical information and best practices for new hires as you grow your team. For remote employees, they may not get the same opportunities to ask one-off questions at your desk, so creating a thorough training plan is especially important for getting them ramped up.

2. Develop your managers into coaches
Part of becoming an effective coach is learning about your direct report; their unique strengths, what drains them, and what motivates them so you can help guide them on their path to success. One way to accomplish this is by asking the right questions at the right cadence. Here are 5 questions you can start asking your people every week during check ins and 1-on-1s:

• What’s going well in your role? Any wins this week?
• What challenges are you facing?
• How are you feeling? What’s the morale around you?
• On a scale of 1-10, how fulfilled are you? Why?
• What can we do to improve employee development initiatives here?

Having intentional conversations on a regular basis will help you form deeper connections with your people. These discussions will also contribute to building a more psychologically safe environment for employees to be open and honest.

3. Enhance cross-departmental collaboration
A truly cohesive workforce that excels at cross-departmental training can help bridge the gap between cultures, give employees the opportunity to learn more about other parts of the business, and encourage more empathy across the board. But the truth is, most teams aren’t natural collaborators.

Without the right structures in place to help your people to connect, some initiatives could run the risk of falling flat. For example, your marketing department is aiming to enhance the company’s brand with new content but doesn’t consult with the sales or customer service teams. If the marketing team isn’t fully aware of the unique pain points of their customers, the message most likely won’t resonate. Although this is just one instance, a collaboration problem could lead to more detrimental results.

4. Emphasize soft skills
Unfortunately, these vital competencies are often de-emphasized in corporate environments. Even the name “soft skills” makes them seem relatively unnecessary, but according to industry analyst, Josh Bersin, “These skills are not ‘soft’ – they’re highly complex, take years to learn, and are always changing in their scope.”

Businesses are a collection of human beings working together, so building core relationship skills, like the ability to collaborate and communicate, is one of the most important things that a company can encourage.

5. Employee development = personal development
Your employees don’t just exist in a professional capacity to serve your organization. They are whole human beings comprised of physical, intellectual, and emotional experiences. For them to evolve both personally and professionally, employee development must be holistic. This includes:

Emotional balance
Ask questions like, “How do you feel about your work lately? Are you struggling with anything?” This meets our basic needs to be seen, heard, acknowledged, and validated—needs that often go unmet in many work environments.

Intellectual growth
Books and seminars don’t just have to be about business. You can provide continuing education around personal finance or fostering healthy relationships.

Physical health
Encouraging your people to step away from their desks when the workday is complete and allowing them to practice more self care shows that you don’t just depend on the skills on their job description, but you care about them as people.

When employees are given the tools to do their jobs well and train to advance in their careers, they are more likely to feel inspired to do their best work. And your reputation for stellar employee development might just encourage the best and brightest candidates to join your team.' , null, null, null);
